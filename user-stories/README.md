# User Stories

## Objective
This task involved translating the use cases from the use case diagram into a set of user stories. This process is crucial for articulating user needs from their perspective, which helps guide the development process and ensure a user-centric approach.

## Implementation
The user stories are documented in the `user-stories.md` file. Each story is structured to clearly state:
- **Who** the user is (`As a [user role]`)
- **What** they want to accomplish (`I want to [action]`)
- **Why** they want to do it (`so that [benefit]`)

This format provides a clear and concise way to define the project's features and their value to the end user. The user stories were derived directly from the actors and use cases defined in the use case diagram.
