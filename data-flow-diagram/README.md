# Data Flow Diagram

## Objective
This task involved creating a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to visualize how data moves through the backend system of the Airbnb Clone. The DFD illustrates the flow of information between external entities, processes, and data stores, providing a high-level overview of the system's data-driven operations.

## Components of the DFD
The diagram is composed of the following key elements:
- **External Entities**: The primary actors who interact with the system, including **Guests**, **Hosts**, and **Admins**.
- **Processes**: The major functional units that transform data, such as **User Management**, **Listing Management**, **Booking System**, and **Payment Processing**.
- **Data Stores**: The locations where data is stored, including the **User Database**, **Property Database**, **Bookings Database**, and **Payments Database**.
- **Data Flows**: The arrows that show the direction and movement of data between entities, processes, and data stores.

## Diagram
The DFD provides a clear map of the system's architecture, showing how user inputs are processed and where data is stored.
